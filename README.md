## User Story
If you're an inspiring artist, creative, or just curious about how or why
anyone would care about art, begin your journey here. Search for an artist to learn 
more about what they did, who they are, and how they made an impression in the world. Find your
art inspiration with Art-Spo. <br />
I WANT an webpage that can give artists inspiration from other artists of art work and make a donation. <br />
SO WHEN I search for a painting it will display image, description and able to save favorite art paintings.
